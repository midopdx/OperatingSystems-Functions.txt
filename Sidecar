Sidecar for MacOS Catalina is a really fine feature.  It allows you to use your ipad as an external display.  
This makes for great flexibilty, if you have an ipad already.  If you don't have an ipad it is not such a fine feature. 
The finder in my OS system Catalina is so easy to use, you dont need to really know anything about computers.  
The click of a button and you can search so many ways. Even if you a new to technology you can do it.
I can't forget about the dock, it is one of my favorite features, you can add the most used items to your dock.  
It is very easy to remove items from the dock you no longer need.  It is just always there ready to have you click what you need.
